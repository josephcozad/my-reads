# My Reads (Project)

This is a [Udacity ReactJS Nanodegree][https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019] project that tracks books being read, books that are in the queue to be read or have already been read.

## Install

Install the module directly from npm:

```
git clone https://github.com/josephcozad/my-reads-project.git
cd my-reads
npm install my-reads
npm start
```

## Usage

Navigate your browser to http://localhost:3000/

An initial display of three categories of books is displayed with thumbnails of each book in each category. Books can be moved from one category to another by clicking on the green pull down arrow on each book and selecting a different category. 'None' will remove the book from the current category. The green plus '+' icon will navigate you to a search page where you can search for new books to add to the app. The left arrow next to the search field will navigate you back to the main app with the display of books being tracked.
